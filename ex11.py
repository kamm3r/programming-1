# Implement a Flask backend service that tells whether a number received
# as a parameter is a prime number or not. Use the prior prime number
# exercise as a starting point. For example, a GET request for number
# 31 is given as: http://127.0.0.1:5000/prime_number/31.
# The response must be in the format of {"Number":31, "isPrime":true}.


# Implement a backend service that gets the ICAO code of an airport
# and then returns the name and location of the airport in JSON format.
# The information is fetched from the airport database used on this course.
# For example, the GET request for EFHK would be:
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/airport/EFHK. The response must be in the format of:
# {"ICAO":"EFHK", "Name":"Helsinki-Vantaa Airport", "Location":"Helsinki"}.
