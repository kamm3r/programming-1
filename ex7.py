# Write a program that asks the user to enter the ICAO code of an airport.
# The program fetches and prints out the corresponding airport
# name and location (town) from the airport database used on this course.
# The ICAO codes are stored in the ident column of the airport table.


# Write a program that asks the user to enter the area code (for example FI)
# and prints out the airports located in that country ordered by airport type.
# For example, Finland has 65 small airports, 15 helicopter airports and so on.


# Write a program that asks the user to enter the ICAO codes of two airports.
# The program prints out the distance between the two airports in kilometers.
# The calculation is based on the airport coordinates fetched from the
# database. Calculate the distance using the geopy library:
# https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. Install the library by
# selecting View / Tool Windows / Python Packages in your PyCharm IDE,
# write geopy into the search field and finish the installation.
