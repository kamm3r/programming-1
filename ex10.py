# Familiarize yourself with the OpenWeather weather API at:
# https://openweathermap.org/api. Your task is to write a program
# that asks the user for the name of a municipality and then prints out
# the corresponding weather condition description text and temperature
# in Celsius degrees. Take a good look at the API documentation.
# You must register for the service to receive the API key required
# for making API requests. Furthermore, find out how you can
# convert Kelvin degrees into Celsius.
